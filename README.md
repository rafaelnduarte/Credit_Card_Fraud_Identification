# Credit_Card_Fraud_Identification

In this project, we're going to address the issue of credit card fraud, one of the greatest concerns of both financial institutions and credit card users.

In Brazil alone, over 12 million people have already fallen victims of financial fraud in the last year. In numbers, that means over US$ 500 mi were lost in the past 12 months.

Among these frauds, those involving credit cards are highly relevant since failure in detecting them means huge losses for both consumers and financial institutions.

Another factor that plays a role in this game is false positives, that is when you try to make a purchase and have your card preventively blocked, which usually comes with stress and embarrassment.

That's why investing in fraud detection through Artificial Intelligence has been growing with the years, which is a great opportunity for Data Scientists.

Having great volume of data, a Machine Learning Algorithm that performs just a little better thant the previous solutions already represents millions of dollars worth of savings. This is the challenge:

Continuously improving the performance of Fraud Detection Systems, to inhibit or avoid fraudulent transactions.
